Number Name ⇄ Numeral Converter
A simple web app that helps you convert:
It follows the International Number System
1. Numbers to number names (e.g., 123 → one hundred twenty-three)
2. Number names to numbers (e.g., one hundred twenty-three → 123)
This project was created to practice finishing a complete mini-project from start to end. Haha!
How to Use:
Choose your conversion type
Use the dropdown to select one of the two options:
a. Number to Words: Enter a number like 450 to get "four hundred fifty"
b. Words to Number: Enter a name like "four hundred fifty" to get 450
Enter your input
Type a number or number name (in English only) in the input field
Example for Number to Words: Enter 99 → You’ll get "ninety-nine"
Example for Words to Number: Enter "ninety-nine" → You’ll get 99

Tip: If you type each digit word separately like "one two three", the app gives a suggestion
It will say something like: “Don’t say ‘one two three’, say ‘one hundred twenty-three’ instead”

Supported Range: Works well from 0 up to a few trillion
Understands words like hundred, thousand, million, billion, and trillion
